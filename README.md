# Should I Buy This?

A simple, opinion-based web tool to help users decide whether they should buy something, not by calculating budgets, but by reflecting on motivations and needs.

👉 **Live site:** https://should-i-buy-this.vercel.app/

## Purpose
This tool helps users think twice before making a purchase by asking short, reflective questions such as:

- "Do I need this?"
- "Do I want this?"
- "Will this matter in a week or a month?"

The goal is mindfulness, not financial advice.

## How It Works

3. A simple qualitative algorithm evaluates the responses.
